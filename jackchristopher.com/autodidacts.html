       <p  style=" text-align: left; ">Never use that word. And don't call yourself one. This ones got a bad rep, but is somewhat saved because many people never heard of it ... unlike philosophy. <br /><br />Most people don't know what it means, and if they do, they'll think you're pretentious.<br /><br />If they've stayed to listen to your explanation, good...<br /><br />If not, you know what they were thinking, "Weird, you...erm, actually enjoy learning?."<br /><br />What's more, after the inevitable resistance, they won't even understand why you would do it.<br /><br />Quick test: <br />Pitch your startup to a bum.<br /><br />What? He doesn't know about web apps? <br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />You're not allowed to explain that many things in a conversaton. (write a book).<br /><br />Even if he did, you wouldn't be able to convince him.<br /><br />No fair? <br />OK, Ok someone smarter. <br /><br />Wait, wait but smart people [/]hate[/] being told what to think. <br /><br />"Really, this app is the new way to do things, that will save me money...No thanks. Everyone already uses x for that"<br /><br />Convincing someone to use your app. Is like trying to convert, a Democrat into a Republican. It's easier to change the undecided.<br /><br />Smart people know not to listen to the authoritative sounding salesman. They like to retain the autonomy of their mind. <br /><br />And whizzing ten concepts by them, feels like being hoodwinked. <br /><br />You feel strange when they are not accepted. Like you poured/drained your soul out to your deepest lover. And were rejected. You feel dejected and no good.<br /><br />(^rewrite) <br /><br />Sometimes, you get the people who are curious, and ask you of your motives. But wait, too long. You can't go on a diatribe about what's wrong with the education system, and when getting into Harvard is their standard for intelligence, it's not even worth it. Oh, they were just asking to see how dumb you are.<br /><br />(Above is too negative.)<br /><br />Why do people become autodidacts?<br /><br />It's a combination of rationality and arrogance. Doing anything new is.<br /><br />I thought I could educate myself better than college could. I didn't like how, they wanted you to fit in a cookie cutter. I had a gut intuition that this was wrong for me.<br /><br />And it forced me to take responsibility for my education, for my life. Like responsibility tends to (make you grow into the role).<br /><br />(Explain your college experience, don't let yourself be defined by the negativity)<br /><br />The worse thing about college was the lack of enthusiasm. I went to a community college. Later on, I would realize they weren't meant for the ambitious. Community college is where you go when you're a GI coming home from the war, to get quick job training.<br /><br />Life sucks when you're around unenthusiastic people. I like people who care about being better at things. I like people who care about the same things I do. I've thought a lot about what to do with my life. And I wanted to make sure I came to the right conclusion.<br /><br />You were not allow to be ambitious here. Unless, your ambition was for the weed, that job that payed slightly more, or alchohol. If you wanted to take a stand you could feel people thinking "Stop that! That's too serious. Now stuff it and go buy something."<br /><br />Humans are curious by default. It could be no other way, for a thinking, moving being/any conscious being would be.<br /><br />Some people think that pressure in being an autodidact is against learning the details. But actually the pressure is to learn everything. There's nothing stoping you from pulling an all-nighter, even night. &nbsp;<br /><br />How can you tell you're smarter than someone else? It's hard to tell where you stand. This fact is amplified by being self-taught. You have no one around to compare yourself with, so you keep going.<br /><br />You can only tell who's smarter by working with them. And like academics, they like big/difficult words and bombast. Understanding breeds consistent results.<br /><br />"Ding!", the autority alarm goes off.<br /><br />And just so I don't we have a working definition of it, what I mean by smarter is.<br />Absolute intelligence measured by, the accuracy of your knowledge and ability to rationally manipulate it.<br /><br />There's no test for measuring how much you know, though we know how much your can storage. But we do have a objective test for your ability to manipulate it (symbols rationally). Mathematics.<br /><br />In mathematics, there is a point where even a highly motivated person tops out.<br /><br />At the high levels of art, you're engineering. At the high levels of engineering, you're doing science. At the high levels of science, you're doing math. But there's nothing more difficult than mathematics.<br /><br />Real art is the difference between Natalie Portman and Jessica Alba. You can tell Natalie Portman, actually wants to get better at it. <br /><br />Real artists want to get better. And believe they can. They have the engineer's philosophy/They think like an engineer/They're engineers.<br /><br />Besides the fashion of relativism, I decided against the arts because seemed so tamed.<br /><br />What's more impactful? Using a refrigerator, designing a new refrigerator or inventing the refrigerator? (Or discovering the knowledge the lead to the refrigerators ? Etc.)<br /><br />Science and technology (science/engineering/math sent the message, "Let's explore the territory." While art said "Let's play with what we have." <br /><br />And like a new species filling a niche; Invention is disruptive.<br /><br />The smarter people figured/infered out this much earlier. And probably knew this, implicitly. The geniuses just skip to math (at four). I don't like how easily people use that word genius.<br /><br />Smart people get to the right answer, quicker.<big><br />&nbsp;</big></p>
